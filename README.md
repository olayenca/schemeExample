## React Native App using IOS URL Scheme Deep Linking 

This app makes use of facebook's [API](https://developers.facebook.com/) to grant access to the app using [oAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) protocol.

A [webpage](https://github.com/olayenca/ios-app-webpage) has been setup to trigger a callback to the app after the oAuth validation process has been completed via the URL scheme defined in [info.plist](./ios/schemeExample/Info.plist)
